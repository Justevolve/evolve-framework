# Getting started

**At the moment, the framework is in alpha stage. The software is still in development, so using it in production environments is not recommended.**

Feedback on the project is more than welcome; should you find a bug, please head over to the [issues tracker](https://github.com/Justevolve/evolve-framework/issues) on the project page.

## Requirements

The requirements that need to be met in order to make the framework run on a WordPress installation are:

* **WordPress 4.0** or higher
* **PHP 5.2.4** or higher
* **MySQL 5.0** or higher

## Installation

Download the latest version available from [this page](https://github.com/Justevolve/evolve-framework/releases) and install the plugin in WordPress, making sure that the name of the plugin folder is `evolve-framework`.

*Renaming the plugin folder is important in order for the plugin to be able to support update notifications.*

After completing the plugin installation, activate it from the Plugins screen in the WordPress admin.

*Although this is not recommended, you can download the development version of the framework off the `master` branch, you can clone it right from the Github repository. Update notifications are turned off in this scenario.*
